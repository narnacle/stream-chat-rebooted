# stream-chat-rebooted

## Active continuation

This repository is an active continuation of Izzy's original
[stream-chat](https://github.com/izzy/stream-chat) project. Full credit for the
original overlay and foundation goes to Izzy.

I am actively maintaining this continuation so the project can keep receiving
updates, fixes, and support beyond the original repository's planned archive.

Chat Overlay for OBS based on [streamer.bot](https://streamer.bot/)'s websocket, using pronouns from [pronouns.alejo.io](https://pronouns.alejo.io/).

## Supported platforms

stream-chat-rebooted supports chat messages from Streamer.bot for Twitch,
YouTube, and Kick. Kick support includes chat messages, emotes, badges, and
message removal after Kick user bans or timeouts.

## Installation

### Local

To use the Chat overlay locally just download the newest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/narnacle/stream-chat-rebooted/releases/) and unpack it somewhere OBS can reach it.

After unpacking you can open `generator.html` in a browser to open the configurator.

### Online

> [!WARNING]
> The online overlay will be disabled in March 2026

While this is the easier method, using the online method comes with some drawbacks. First and foremost that Github has a soft limit on Bandwidth and Availability. There is no guarantee that this will always work.

Also keep in mind that Github has their own [data collection policies](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#data-collection).

### Configuration

Supported settings are in [options.md](options.md). It's easier to use the generator page, but in case you want to build the URL by hand or programatically, these might be helpful

## Troubleshooting
Generally the best way to troubleshoot is to open the browser console (F12) and check for any errors. Error messages in the console might differ depending on your browser. Given OBS is based on CEF(Chromium Embedded Framework) it's likely that Chrome's console is the most accurate.

### Settings set in the generator aren't working in OBS
#### Possible reasons:

* You have not removed the `Local File` checkbox in the OBS Source

#### Solution

* Uncheck `Local File` and paste the generated URL again

### Can't connect to WebSocket

#### Possible errors in the console:

* Firefox can’t establish a connection to the server at ws://127.0.0.1:8080/
* Websocket connection to 'ws://127.0.0.1:8080/' failed: [...]

#### Possible reasons:

* Streamer.Bot is not running
* Streamer.Bot is listening on a different port
* Streamer.Bot is listening on a port that is not exclusively available

#### Troubleshooting:

* Make sure Streamer.Bot is running
* If you're using a custom port, make sure it's the same as the one in the overlay's URL
* If you're using a custom port, make sure it's not in use by another application(try a different port)
* To make sure the port is exclusively available, close Streamer.Bot and run `Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8080).OwningProcess` in PowerShell. If the output is empty, the port is available, otherwise it's in use by another process and you should probably try a different port.

### WebSocket connected but doesn't show messages

#### Possible errors in the console:

* No direct errors
* Log will say connected, but not say `SUBSCRIBE: ok`

#### Possible reasons:

* Wrong kind of Streamer.Bot websocket server started

#### Troubleshooting:

* Make sure that in Streamer.Bot you started the internal Websocket server(under "Websocket Server"), not a custom one(under "Websocket Servers" - mind the plural)
